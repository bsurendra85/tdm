/**
 * This resource wraps a single endpoint REST API which means it is not resource oriented.
 * The API uses query parameters to identify the request.
 *
 * Thi example shows how to define the model so it can normalize the endpoint into a resource.
 *
 * To get a single title we need to use the "title" query param which returns 404 if it does not exist or the title object if exists.
 * This indicate that the title is the @Identity key.
 *
 * The other query params (director, actor, year) return an array so they are query calls.
 * The base "query" method does not have a mandatory filter parameter so we will have to use ExtendAction
 * to overload the signature and provide our logic before executing the query.

      Extending the "query" action to support out special use case.
      This can be done in many ways but this demonstrates overloading core actions.

      Note that while the query signature now accepts 2 mandatory parameters the old signature
      will also work, this is overloading.
      The overloading is virtual, in the type world, but in the runtime mode only 1 method runs, the new one.
