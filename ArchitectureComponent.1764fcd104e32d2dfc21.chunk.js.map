We do this in template\\nand model driven forms.</p>\\n<p>With template-driven forms modeling is embedded within the templates and\\nlater extracted to create form, with model-driven forms it is more\\nvisible especially when using the form builder.</p>\\n<p>Let&#39;s examine it using the <code>Hero</code> class (model):</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang-ts\\\"><code class=\\\"lang-ts\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> Hero {\\n  id: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">number</span>;\\n  name: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">string</span>;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Let&#39;s build a form factory for it:</p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang-ts\\\"><code class=\\\"lang-ts\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">heroForm</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">builder: FormBuilder</span>): <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">FormGroup</span> </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> builder.group({\\n    id: <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n    name: <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>    \\n  });\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We get back a <code>FormGroup</code> instance representing the structure of the \\n<code>Hero</code> class, in low detail (no type information)</p>\\n<p>To visualize the structure we get back, think of this class: </p>\\n<pre class=\\\"lang-ts\\\"><code class=\\\"lang-ts\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> HeroFormGroup {\\n  id: FormControl;\\n  name: FormControl;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>It is similar to our <code>Hero</code> class but with no type information, just a\\nstructure.</p>\\n<p>Notice how a <code>FormControl</code> has no type information, it accepts any\\nvalue.

controls.</p>\\n<p>While it is possible to render a form from it&#39;s <code>FormGroup</code> instance alone\\nthis is not dynamic, we need a controller.</p>\\n<p>The library comes with a set of tools and services that make it easy to\\nmanage the transformation and a controller class <code>TDMModelForm</code> that\\nencapsulate a model and a form and manage the transformation between them.  </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>While the services, tools and the <code>TDMModelForm</code> instance are core\\ncomponents, this tutorial will not cover them in depth as they\\ninvolve imperative coding and we aim for the declarative approach.\\nSuffice to say that they are used by the library to provide the declarative\\nexperience building dynamic forms.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><code>TDMModelForm</code> provides, among other things, access to the metadata\\nrequired to render a form (not to confuse with creating a form instance).<br>Each metadata object represents a property on the model and a form control in the form.<br>By iterating over the metadata objects (<code>ngFor</code>) we can render the controls\\n(thing <code>ngSwitchCase</code>) based on the type defined within the metadata.</p>\\n<p>We need a component that can take advantage of <code>TDMModelForm</code>, add some sugar\\nand provides the perfect dynamic form experience...</p>\\n<p><code>DynamicFormComponent</code> is what we need.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"dynamicformcomponent-dynamic-form-\\\">DynamicFormComponent (<code>dynamic-form</code>)</h2>\\n<p><code>DynamicFormComponent</code> abstracts <code>TDMModelForm</code> and exposes a declarative\\nAPI and additional features such add local control template override,\\nevents, array control notification and more.</p>\\n<p><code>DynamicFormComponent</code> knows how to render a form just by giving it\\nand instance but it does not have a concrete UI implementation, it \\nrequires external help.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"agnostic-ui\\\">Agnostic UI</h2>\\n<p>We know that A form control instance represents a UI element that we need to show\\nthe user so we can get input, but how does it look?</p>\\n<p>A simple <code>text</code> control, will it be material style? bootstrap style? custom style?</p>\\n<p>The library does not know and can not decide that for the user, it must\\nwork with every component that can host a form control.</p>\\n<p>You are responsible to teach the library what to render for each field.\\nAs mentioned before, we have a list of metadata objects of fields we need to render\\nand for each field we need to have a template, this is a classic <code>ngSwitchCase</code> solution\\nor manually using a
